# Clustering Chapter Summary

This chapter introduces clustering, a core unsupervised learning technique for discovering structure in data. Key topics include:

- **Overview:** Clustering aims to group data points into meaningful clusters based on similarity, without using labeled targets. There is no single correct clustering; the result depends on the definition of similarity and the assumptions made.

- **k-Means Algorithm:** k-means is a widely used clustering algorithm that partitions data into $r$ clusters (historically called $k$). It assumes data points are vectors in Euclidean space and uses Euclidean distance to measure similarity. Each point belongs to exactly one cluster, and clusters are defined as partitions of the data indices. The algorithm seeks to minimize the average squared distance between points within the same cluster.

- **Motivation and Examples:** The chapter uses examples such as grouping playing cards by suit, rank, or color to illustrate the flexibility of clustering. Visual examples with synthetic data (e.g., blobs) show how clusters can be detected in low-dimensional space.

- **Mathematical Formulation:** Clusters are defined as index sets $\mathcal{C}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{C}_r$ forming a partition of the data. The objective is to minimize within-cluster distances, typically using the squared Euclidean norm.

Mathematical notation and Python code are used throughout to clarify the clustering process and its assumptions.
