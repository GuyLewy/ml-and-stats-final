# Regression Chapter Summary

This chapter covers the theory and practice of regression in machine learning. Key topics include:

- **Overview:** Regression is the task of modeling the relationship between input features and a continuous target variable. Recommended literature includes Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" (sections on linear basis function models and bias-variance decomposition) and "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (sections on statistical models, supervised learning, and model selection).

- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff:** The bias-variance tradeoff is central to understanding model performance. The expected prediction error (EPE) can be decomposed into bias, variance, and noise. High-bias models underfit the data, while high-variance models overfit. The chapter uses synthetic data and polynomial regression to illustrate these concepts, showing how model complexity affects bias and variance.

- **Evaluation:** Since the true regression function is unknown in practice, model evaluation relies on test sets to assess generalization. The chapter demonstrates how to generate synthetic data, fit models of varying complexity, and visualize the effects of underfitting and overfitting.

- **Mathematical Formulation:** The chapter provides mathematical definitions and examples, including the use of polynomial features, least squares solutions, and the impact of noise on regression.

Mathematical notation and Python code are used throughout to clarify concepts such as the bias-variance decomposition and the practical evaluation of regression models.
